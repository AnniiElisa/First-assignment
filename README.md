# First-assignment
Full description and explanation in the README file.

This repository contains my first ever (if small added bits of code to my teenage blog don't count) code.
In my vocational school I had some studies from media assistants' studies and in one course I did, small part of it contained 
some HTML and CSS studies. Course speed was relatively slow so I ended up studying the content fully remotely by myself using w3schools.

After a few hours of learning what in the world this is about, I wrote the code that is shown in this repository.

Main focal point of the course was graphics and with this I ended up getting the best score from that course.

My code has a bunch of errors and things I forgot to add in the end but I wanted to keep it untouched to show the progress.
